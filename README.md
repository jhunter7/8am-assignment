# 8am Infrastructure Design

A comprehensive infrastructure design for a modern, secure, and scalable application platform supporting internet-facing web applications, backend services, and internal admin tools.

## Overview

This repository contains a complete infrastructure design that addresses all core requirements including secure intercommunication, self-healing systems, sensitive configuration management, data persistence, consistent deployment processes, and strong observability.

### Applications & Services

- **Internet-facing Web App**: Spring Boot with React frontend
- **Backend Services**: Node.js microservices with event-driven architecture
- **Internal Admin Tool**: Spring Boot with Angular, Boundary-only access

### Core Infrastructure

- **Service Mesh**: Linkerd for mTLS communication and traffic management
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes for deployment and scaling
- **Message Queue**: Apache Kafka for event streaming and asynchronous processing
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching and Elasticsearch indexing
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault with External Secrets Operator
- **Access Control**: HashiCorp Boundary for secure DevOps access

### Security & Access

- **Network Security**: Multi-tier network segmentation with firewalls
- **Encryption**: TLS 1.3 for external communication, mTLS for internal
- **Access Control**: RBAC, MFA, Boundary access for admin tools
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault for sensitive configuration

### Observability

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for time-series data collection
- **Logging**: Centralized logging with Fluentd and Elasticsearch
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed request tracing
- **Dashboards**: Grafana for visualization and monitoring

## Key Features

### Security
- End-to-end encryption for all communication
- Multi-tier network segmentation
- HashiCorp Vault for secret management
- Network policies for pod isolation
- RBAC for access control
- Boundary for secure access

### Scalability
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Multi-zone deployment
- Load balancing and traffic management
- Resource optimization

### Reliability
- Self-healing systems with health checks
- Automated failover and recovery
- Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms
- Backup and disaster recovery

### Observability
- Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus
- Centralized logging with Elasticsearch
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Real-time dashboards with Grafana

## Requirements Mapping

### Core Requirements
- **Intercommunication**: Linkerd service mesh with mTLS
- **Self-healing**: Kubernetes health checks and auto-recovery
- **Sensitive configuration**: HashiCorp Vault integration
- **Data persistence**: PostgreSQL with Redis and Elasticsearch
- **Deployment**: Consistent CI/CD pipeline with quality gates
- **Promotion & approval**: Manual approval gates and automated validation
- **Access**: HashiCorp Boundary for secure DevOps access
- **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger

### Bonus Considerations
- **Isolation**: Network segmentation and workload isolation
- **Redundancy**: Multi-zone deployment with failover capabilities

### Double Bonus
- **Phased rollouts**: Argo Rollouts with canary deployments
- **Automated validation**: Prometheus-based metrics validation and automated rollback
